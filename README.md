# Re-implementation of softScheck/tplink-smartplug to work as REST API & Docker

A re-implementation of this software to works as REST API in a Raspberry PI

## tplink_smartplug.py ##

A python client for the proprietary TP-Link Smart Home protocol to control TP-Link HS100 and HS110 WiFi Smart Plugs.
The SmartHome protocol runs on TCP port 9999 and uses a trivial XOR autokey encryption that provides no security. 

There is no authentication mechanism and commands are accepted independent of device state (configured/unconfigured).


Commands are formatted using JSON, for example:

  `{"system":{"get_sysinfo":null}}`

Instead of `null` we can also write `{}`. Commands can be nested, for example:

  `{"system":{"get_sysinfo":null},"time":{"get_time":null}}`

A full list of commands is provided in [tplink-smarthome-commands.txt](tplink-smarthome-commands.txt).


#### Usage ####

   `./tplink_smartplug.py -t <ip> [-c <cmd> || -j <json>]`

Provide the target IP using `-t` and a command to send using either `-c` or `-j`. Commands for the `-c` flag:

| Command   | Description                          |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|
| on        | Turns on the plug                    |
| off       | Turns off the plug                   |
| info      | Returns device info                  |
| cloudinfo | Returns cloud connectivity info      |
| wlanscan  | Scan for nearby access points        |
| time      | Returns the system time              |
| schedule  | Lists configured schedule rules      |
| countdown | Lists configured countdown rules     |
| antitheft | Lists configured antitheft rules     |
| reboot    | Reboot the device                    |
| reset     | Reset the device to factory settings |
| energy    | Return realtime voltage/current/power|

More advanced commands such as creating or editing rules can be issued using the `-j` flag by providing the full JSON string for the command. Please consult [tplink-smarthome-commands.txt](tplink-smarthome-commands.txt) for a comprehensive list of commands.
